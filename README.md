# sql-scripts

In my day to day, I oftentimes have to manage SQL Server instances. The scripts contained in this folder are custom scripts and queries I have put together to accomplish usually pretty specific goals. 

These are problems I have come across, or requests that I have gotten, and was able to solve them through code. 

Some were single use scenarios, but I still tend to keep them around in case I encounter the problem or request again.
